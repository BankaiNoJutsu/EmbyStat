## Pull requests

I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests. You can make a pull request by following these guidelines:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`. Use following url to fork: `https://github.com/mregni/EmbyStat.git`
2. Add your code.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code location

- Frontend code is located in the EmbyStat.Web project.
- Backend code starts in the EmbyStat.Controllers project.
- Test project is located in Tests.Unit

## Write bug reports
