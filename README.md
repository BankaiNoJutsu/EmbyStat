EmbyStat is a personal web server that can calculate all kinds of statistics from your (local) Emby server. Just install this on your server and let him calculate all kinds of fun stuff.

This project is still in Alpha fase, but feel free to pull in on your computer and test it out yourself. When the time is right I will host a full informational website/release for common platforms and Wiki pages.

# Installation
Supported platforms as the moment are:
* Windows x64 (IIS and Kestrel)
* Windows x86 (IIS and Kestrel)
* Docker Windows [latest-win](https://hub.docker.com/r/uping/embystat/)
* Docker Linux [latest-linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/uping/embystat/)

I will try to support as many platforms as possible. More and more will come in the future!
If you have knownlegde about building unix packages please feel free to contact me so I can support as many platforms as possible.

# Roadmap
A lot of things need to be done before I can go life with this and publish my first 1.0 release. This will happen when all features from the Emby statistics plugin are implemented in EmbyStat.
